The ESP32 is a powerful IOT tool. It is a low-cost system-on-chip (SoC) series created by Espressif Systems. 
It is an improvement on the popular ESP8266 that is widely used in IoT projects. The ESP32 has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, 
which make it an all-rounded chip for the development of IoT projects and embedded systems in general.

The DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor is a nice little module that provides digital temperature and humidity readings.
Itâ€™s really easy to set up, and only requires one wire for the data signal. These sensors are popular for use in remote weather stations,
soil monitors, and home automation systems.

ThingSpeak is an Open-Source IoT application and API to store and retrieve data from Hardware devices and Sensors.
It uses HTTP Protocol over the Internet or LAN for its communication.
The MATLAB analytics is included to analyze and visualize the data received from your Hardware or Sensor Devices.

We can create channels for each and every sensor data. These channels can be set as private channels or you can share the data publically through Public channels.
The commercial features include additional features.
But we will be using the free version as we doing it for educational purpose.
